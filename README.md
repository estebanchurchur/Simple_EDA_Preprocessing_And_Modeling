# Simple EDA, Preprocessing, and Modeling

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks and model files aimed at performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and machine learning modeling for customer churn prediction. The focus is on utilizing logistic regression and random forest models to analyze the Telco Customer Churn dataset.

## Contents

- **Exploring.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis on the Telco Customer Churn dataset.
- **Preprocessing_and_Modeling.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook that covers data preprocessing steps and modeling using logistic regression and random forest algorithms.
- **LR_Churn_model.pkl**: A saved logistic regression model for predicting customer churn.
- **RF_Churn_model.pkl**: A saved random forest model for predicting customer churn.
- **Telco-Customer-Churn.csv**: The dataset used for analysis and modeling.
- **requirements.txt**: A file listing the necessary Python packages required to run the notebooks.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/estebanchurchur/Simple_EDA_Preprocessing_And_Modeling.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Simple_EDA_Preprocessing_And_Modeling

3. **Install the required packages(Recommend you set up a virtual environment)**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. **Open the Jupyter Notebooks**:
Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the ```Exploring.ipynb``` and ```Preprocessing_and_Modeling.ipynb``` files to start your analysis.

##Usage
Use the ```Exploring.ipynb``` notebook to perform EDA on the Telco Customer Churn dataset, visualizing key metrics and identifying trends.
The ```Preprocessing_and_Modeling.ipynb``` notebook guides you through data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training.
Load the saved models (```LR_Churn_model.pkl and RF_Churn_model.pkl```) to make predictions on new data.
